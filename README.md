# 3D Gaussian Splatting Tutorial

This repository contains the dataset, models, and scripts used in the tutorial:

[From Real Object to 3D Gaussian Splatting Model Using Open-Source Tools](https://smartdatascan.com/tutorials/gaussian-splatting-windows/)  

The tutorial demonstrates how to reconstruct a real-world object as a 3D Gaussian Splatting model using COLMAP, gsplat, and the SuperSplat Editor on Windows.

## Contents

- `datasets/` – Original and downsampled images, COLMAP database, and sparse reconstruction
- `results/` – Trained Gaussian splatting models (original, cleaned, compressed)
- `scripts/` – Batch files for COLMAP reconstruction (default and adjusted variants)
